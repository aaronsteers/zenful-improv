# Ground Rules for Play

A few proposed ground rules for play.

## 1. Everything is practice

Were are all always practicing, always learning.

## 2. Communicate boundaries, respect boundaries

Improv is intimate - let's make sure everyone comes away with a positive experience. Make sure you communicate your boundaries, and make sure you respect the boundaries of others. If you are unsure of your partner's boundaries, please ask.

## 3. There are no mistakes, only opportunities for change

Learning happens best when we accept that we did the best we could in each moment, while at the same time being mindful of what we may want to do differently in the future.

## 4. Listen to your partner; listen to your body

Improv is the ultimate listening exercise. Every tone of voice, inflection, body movement, and word choice is information that our partner is giving us. Every gut instinct or emotion is information that our bodies are giving us.

## 5. Be generous, be humble

We strive to be generous and kind to each other.
